### Bot for extracting information

The idea for this one came when i was checking out the companies that will provide a skilled worker visa.I can find this data from [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers). But the problem was there was no sector details like what was the company doing.

So I first checked if this information was available in the Uk government website and I found that it was under each company section as nature of business.

So, I wrote the code to extract this information. which can be found in the webscraper.py file.

The data plotted on chart can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/athul.kallungal/viz/TechcompaniesUKsponsor/TechSponsorChart?publish=yes)

Note this was done for educational purpose and for the sake of testing I just kept it to the first 500 companies.
